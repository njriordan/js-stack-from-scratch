## Background
This project was a chance for me to experiment with various aspects of the modern Javascript stack. It is based on this [tutorial](https://github.com/verekia/js-stack-from-scratch).

## Live demo
The live demo is available [here](https://js-from-scratch.herokuapp.com/). However, the principles behind the code are probably more interesting than the app itself.

## Features

* **React**
* **Redux**
* Webpack
* Babel
* **Static type-checking** with [**Flow**](https://flow.org/)
* **Server-side rendering**
* [Socket.io](https://socket.io/)
* **Unit testing** with Jest
* Continuous integration testing with [Travis](https://travis-ci.org/)
* Deployment with Heroku
